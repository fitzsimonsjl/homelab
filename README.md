# homelab
A repository for all the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that makes up my homelab (currently pure Dockerfile). Versions have been split into folders for readability. Each version contains the related IaC files individually as well as a file for all services together for easier deployment. The current version and plans for future versions can be found below:

|Version|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|v1|Docker files|
|v2|Kubernetes cluster|
|v3|Provisioning server and Kubernetes cluster with Terraform|

The current services that I am self-hosting are:

- Jellyfin
- Calibre
- FreshRSS
- Nextcloud
